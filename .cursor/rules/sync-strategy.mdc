# Sync Strategy

The Fergus-Airtable sync system employs a multi-layered approach to ensure data is kept up-to-date.

## Three-Tier Sync Strategy

1. **Daily Incremental Sync** ([incremental-sync.js](mdc:incremental-sync.js))
   - Runs daily (e.g., overnight at 2am)
   - Only processes jobs that have changed since last run
   - Fast and efficient with minimal API usage

2. **Invoice-Focused Sync** ([sync-fergus-invoices.js](mdc:sync-fergus-invoices.js))
   - Runs 2-3 times weekly (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
   - Specifically focuses on invoice discovery and syncing
   - Uses status board data to find invoice IDs

3. **Weekly Full Sync** ([direct-fergus-api.js](mdc:direct-fergus-api.js))
   - Runs weekly (e.g., Sunday night)
   - Complete refresh of all jobs and data
   - Backup to ensure no data is missed

## Setting Up Automated Syncs

Multiple deployment options are available:

```bash
# Cron example (run incremental sync at 2am daily)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/fergus && node incremental-sync.js >> logs/sync.log 2>&1

# Cron example (run invoice sync Mon/Wed/Fri at 3am)
0 3 * * 1,3,5 cd /path/to/fergus && node sync-fergus-invoices.js >> logs/invoice-sync.log 2>&1

# Cron example (run full sync Sunday at 1am)
0 1 * * 0 cd /path/to/fergus && node direct-fergus-api.js >> logs/full-sync.log 2>&1
```

## Upsert Logic

All syncs use "upsert" operations on Airtable:
- If a record exists (matched by ID or number), it's updated
- If no matching record exists, a new one is created
