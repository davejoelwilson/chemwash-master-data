# Invoice Syncing

This system uses multiple methods to discover and sync invoices from Fergus to Airtable.

## Key APIs for Invoice Detection

The most reliable method is through the status board data endpoint:

```javascript
// [sync-fergus-invoices.js](mdc:sync-fergus-invoices.js)
const url = 'https://app.fergus.com/api/v2/status_board/data';
```

This returns data with `works_order_ids` and `customer_invoice_ids`.

## Invoice Types

Two main types of invoices are handled:

1. **Customer Invoices**: Finalized invoices sent to customers
2. **Works Orders**: Pre-invoice items that are ready to be converted to invoices

## Implementation Strategy

The invoice sync process:

1. Extract invoice IDs from status board data
2. Fetch detailed information using those IDs
3. Process and format for Airtable
4. Perform upsert operations (update existing or create new)

## Airtable Integration

Invoices are synced to an "Invoices" table with fields including:
- Invoice Number
- Invoice Reference
- Fergus Site Address
- Amount Paid
- Invoice Status
- Customer
- Invoice Date

See [invoice-handling.md](mdc:docs/invoice-handling.md) for more detailed documentation.
